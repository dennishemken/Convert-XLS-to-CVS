Full-time.,"I work as a bartender at both a craft beer bar/growler fill house, and a more traditional bar/restaurant.",Nope,I've previously used Coursera as a resource for beginner Python programming courses.,No,2.0,7.0,8.0,5.0,,"During my undergraduate studies at CU Boulder (BA Linguistics), I took an elective course in Python/C++ coding, and discovered I had a knack for it, as well as an inherent interest in the subject matter. Coding, for me, dovetailed conceptually with the courses and ideas I found most engaging within my studies of Linguistics and Philosophy (I ended up not completing my degree in Philosophy due to financial and time constraints): it was a real-world application of symbolic logic (my favorite subject, with the added thrill of watching your logic proofs come to life, as opposed to just sitting there, completed yet static, unmoving), contained similar themes of conceptualizing and structuring internally coherent systems of meaning, which captivated my attention within subjects such as psycholinguistics, semantics, and cognitive linguistics/science, and, most importantly, it was something I eventually found myself occupying all of my available time with; not because I had to, but because I wanted to.

After the programming course, I earnestly considered changing my degree to Programming/Computer Science. However, at that point, I was also within short reach of completing my Linguistics degree, and felt relinquishing years of invested effort towards that goal would be a step in the wrong direction. In retrospect - after finding myself post degree within a career path/job market I had no real interest in pursuing - I should have heeded that nagging gut feeling, telling me to pursue a subject of study and eventual career path that effortlessly and inherently captured my interest, as opposed to one motivated by a sense of ultimately misplaced personal obligation.

My motivations for joining Hack University is to finally start building the skills and knowledge base that will allow me to enter a career field I am genuinely excited about on a fundamental, personal level - one I can envision growing within for the rest of my life. For the past few years I've attempted to start that transition, but, due to time constraints involving available coding courses/opportunities being incompatible with my work schedule, as well as several financial roadblocks (making it absolutely necessary to maximize an all-consuming, inflexible work schedule), the transition has stalled. Hack University, with its structure and timeframe, presents the perfect opportunity to jump-start my goals, in a way that is complimentary to my current, pre-existing obligations in work and life.","I heard about the program through my partner, who has a 52 Limited email subscription.",What an amazing program!
