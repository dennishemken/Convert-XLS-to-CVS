I also have almost no design skills, but have managed my way around the Adobe suite for years, again, as needed by my job. 

Mostly, I'm HTML/CSS/JS, and now heavily into thick-client work, almost entirely with Angular (1.x, also exposure to and knowledge of React, Backbone, and Knockout). I've worked on fairly major and relatively complex applications using an API-driven client, with a modern client-side build (NPM, Grunt, Webpack, a smidge of Gulp), haltingly written and run some unit tests, and generally made things work.

But I basically work solo (as a front-ender; I work with back-end devs all day long), and want to be around some quality coders outside of work to improve my skills and confidence. I'd also like to expand to be somewhat full-stack, and maybe even to do a bit of design, or at least flex skills in that direction. Apps I work on tend to be light on any sort of challenging design work.

Finally, I have a lot of background in other areas, including years of liberal-arts schooling and experience in government, science, and non-profit work, and so I'm interested in the work of Hack/Code Oregon, and the option to contribute to a meaningful project.

Lastly, I'm not young and also have two young kids, so my time is somewhat limited, but I hope I can fit in at least a class and some extracurricular time.

I am registered with WorkSource Oregon, looking into Code Oregon, Hack Oregon a regular participant/volunteer in local events and a full-stack web dev using RoR, who wishes to expand my knowledge and find work in the field. The day this course starts is also my birthday October 11th, so it would be a wonderful surprise to be awarded a scholarship. I should also mention that not having formal data science training, only on the job, I believe has held me back so far in attaining a position, I believe this course would improve my chances when applying. I am happy to provide a resume or other documents should they be desired, just let me know.

Thank you for your consideration!
